Testing of the Skype mobile application. UI testing, tests for interruption, testing of performance, orientation testing, testing for interruption, testing of performance was held. I created a test documentation (Structure of the application, the test the plan, the check list, bug reports, report on testing). For testing were used by Charles and Android Studio programs

In order to determine what types of testing will be carried out, as well as the risks and time that will be spent on the project, a test plan was created

An application structure was created to make it easier to test application modules

Check list was created for the main modules of the application
